# Research Materials Staging Area

This directory (`/research_materials`) is intentionally kept entirely separate from the React frontend and the FastAPI backend codebases. 

You can use this space to drop in your own:
- **PDFs**, **Word Documents**, or **Excel Sheets** containing data and research.
- **Drafts** for new articles, case studies, or methodologies.
- **Raw Data** outlining new capabilities.

### How to integrate this later into the Insights section:
When your research is finalized and you want to publish it to the live website's "Insights" journal:
1. You can drop the text/content directly into the `Pages` or `Insights` table in your SQLite database.
2. Or, you can ask me to write an ingestion script or simply translate these raw Markdown/Word docs into the correct format for the website.
